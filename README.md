# CamApp2

<h2><b>The Idea:</b></h2>
We live in a fast-paced, instant-gratification, tech-driven world. As a millenial, sometimes I miss when I had to wait on things. There is mystery and value added when you have to wait. This app is designed to re-introduce photography to the world, where each photo costs something - a little time, a little money - so that the memories they hold are cherished a little more.
</br>
</br>
Ultimately, this is a disposable camera app. You get a "roll" of 27 photos, you can't see your photos when they are taken, the "film" is not saved on your camera roll, and when you run out of photos, you have to have them printed and shipped to you to be able to see them. There are no cute puppy filters or image retouching. The image you get is how that moment was. Just like the 90s to early 2000s!
</br>
</br>
This is a continuation of the Cam App project (see repository: https://github.com/andrea-e-c/camapp).
</br>
</br>
There were some limitations to using Expo Go. Specifically, I wanted to add an automatic filter to the images captured in the app so that they could look like they were snapped on film. To do this, I decided to re-make the app in a plain React Native project, which was initialized in Typescript, so hey, I'm working out that muscle as well.


<h2><b>Getting Started</b></h2>
React Native uses Ruby for some ios dependency management. Make sure you have Ruby installed on your computer. This project uses Ruby 2.7.6 (See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#ruby for more info).
</br>
Make sure you have Xcode as well.
</br>
Download the repository and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies.
</br>
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
</br>
</br>
Run "npm start" to open the Metro Builder. Then press "i" to run the ios builder or "a" to run the Android builder.

<b>This app utilizes the phone camera, which will not display properly on your computer.</b>
