# CamApp2

This is a continuation of the Cam App project (see repository: https://github.com/andrea-e-c/camapp).

There were some limitations to using Expo Go. Specifically, I wanted to add filters to the images captured in the app so that they could look like they were snapped on film. To do this, I decided to remake the app in a plain React Native project, which was initialized in Typescript, so hey, I'm working out that muscle as well.


<b>Getting Started</b>
</br>
React Native uses Ruby for some ios dependency management. Make sure you have Ruby installed on your computer. This project uses Ruby 2.7.6 (See https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#ruby for more info).
</br>
Make sure you have Xcode as well.
</br>
Download the repository and run "npm install" to install all necessary dependencies.
</br>
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
</br>
</br>
Run "npm start" to open the Metro Builder. Then press "i" to run the ios builder or "a" to run the Android builder.

<b>This app utilizes the phone camera, which will not display properly on your computer.</b>
