# CamApp2

This is a continuation of the Cam App project (see repository: https://github.com/andrea-e-c/camapp).

There were some limitations to using Expo Go. Specifically, I wanted to add filters to the images captured in the app so that they could look like they were snapped on film. To do this, I decided to remake the app in a plain React Native project, which was initialized in Typescript, so hey, I'm working out that muscle as well.

I don't really have any instructions for you to use this yet. Once I get a few more commits in and have a functional app, I'll update this readme.
